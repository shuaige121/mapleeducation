# TODO (Restore legacy experience)

- [ ] Matching: auto-run on input change for destination/goal/budget/notes (added basic auto-run, refine debounce & UX).
- [ ] Mobile polish: mirror legacy responsive layout (School_Matchboard) with multi-language UI.
- [ ] Multi-language: reintroduce i18n (EN/中文) with locale toggle and persistence.
- [ ] Document automation: one-click contract/invoice generation UX parity with legacy; add history list with download.
- [ ] Calendar reminders: prefilled Google Calendar links are present; add saved reminders list and key dates presets.
- [ ] NAS/DB sync: add scheduled sync (docker cron/worker) to pull/push daily so client always up to date; document container path.
- [ ] Hosting split: keep B2C/School_Matchboard (Next.js) alongside internal Flutter app, or migrate legacy UI into Flutter.
- [ ] Firestore rules: currently open for convenience; tighten after requirements are final.
